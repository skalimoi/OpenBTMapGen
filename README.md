# OpenBattlesim Scenario Generator

This is a complementary project related to ![OpenBattleSim](https://github.com/skalimoi/OpenBattlesim) and consists of a standalone Scenario Generator that players will be able to use to create customized environments ready to use in OpenBattlesim.

It can generate 2^n sized maps from various types of noise and apply erosive forces to the terrain to make it realistic and generate water/river masks. Additionally, a Weather editor is also included, which enables users to specify custom weather parameters and view the prelimitary simulations on a 3D grid.

## Development note

Currently only the topography systems (erosion, noise generation and visualization) are finished. The weather editor is on the works.
