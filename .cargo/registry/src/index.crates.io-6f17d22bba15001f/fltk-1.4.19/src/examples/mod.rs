Documentation for the examples

Each file is a standalone executable with its own main function. Examples vary from basic hello world simplicity to some more complex examples. They may contain logic bugs, however their purpose is for demonstration and for testing UI elements. If you would like to contribute fixes, improvements or more examples, you're very welcome to do so.

More interesting examples can be found in the fltk-rs-demos [repo](https://github.com/fltk-rs/demos).
Also a nice implementation of the 7guis tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/tdryer/7guis-fltk-rs).
Various advanced examples can also be found [here](https://github.com/wyhinton/FLTK-RS-Examples).
