//!Documentation for the `gradients` example
//!
//!This is the documentation for the example `gradients.rs`. The code can be found in the `examples` directory next to the `src` directory in the source distribution.
//!This shows 2 main ways of showing gradients. The first is by drawing the gradient manually using draw::draw_xyline and draw_yxline.
//!The second is by using an SVG with LinearGradient
