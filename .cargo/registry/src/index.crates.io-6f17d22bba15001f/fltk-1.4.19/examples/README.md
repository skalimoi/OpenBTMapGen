# Examples

Each file is a standalone executable with its own main function. Examples vary from basic hello world simplicity to some more complex examples. They may contain logic bugs, however their purpose is for demonstration and for testing UI elements. If you would like to contribute fixes, improvements or more examples, you're very welcome to do so.

To run the examples: 
```
$ cargo run --example editor
$ cargo run --example calculator
$ cargo run --example calculator2
$ cargo run --example tabs
$ cargo run --example terminal

$ cargo run --example hello
